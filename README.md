# LeetCode

This is my attempt to do 1 LeetCode problem a day, for idk how long.
And while it sounds easy enough, the goal is not solving LeetCode problems in on itself,
it's rather the consistency of doing it that is the end goal.

- First, do 50 easy. (Done)
- Then, do 50 medium. (In progress)
- Finally, do ♾️ hard.


## Naming convention
- Directory
    - 1_P1_LC2_Add_two_numbers
        - 1: Day number
        - P1: Problem number (could have multiple problems done in the same day)
        - LC: "LeetCode" problem
        - 2_Add_two_numbers: The actual problem name divided by an underscore instead of a whitespace.

## Status
The status of each problem could be:
- Solved ✅
- Not solved ❌
- Solved/Hint used ⚠️
